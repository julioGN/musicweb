## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of MusicWeb seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do Not Report Security Vulnerabilities Through Public Issues

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

### 2. Report via Private Communication

Send a detailed report to: **security@musicweb.app**

Include the following information:
- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receiving your report
- **Assessment**: Within 7 days we'll provide an initial assessment
- **Fix Timeline**: Critical issues will be patched within 30 days
- **Disclosure**: We'll coordinate public disclosure after fixes are available

### 4. Security Update Process

1. We acknowledge your report and begin investigation
2. We develop and test a fix
3. We prepare a security advisory
4. We release the patched version
5. We publish the security advisory

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version of MusicWeb
2. **Secure Credentials**: Never share API keys or authentication tokens
3. **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive data in environment variables, not in code
4. **Network Security**: Use HTTPS when deploying web interfaces
5. **Data Privacy**: Be cautious when uploading personal music library data

### For Developers

1. **Dependencies**: Regularly update dependencies and scan for vulnerabilities
2. **Code Review**: All code changes require review before merging
3. **Static Analysis**: Use security linters and static analysis tools
4. **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs
5. **Error Handling**: Never expose sensitive information in error messages

## Known Security Considerations

### Data Handling
- MusicWeb processes music library data which may contain personal information
- Data is processed locally and not transmitted to external servers (except for configured integrations)
- Users should be cautious when sharing library files or results

### API Keys
- External platform integrations require API keys
- Keys should be stored securely using environment variables
- Never commit API keys to version control

### Web Interface
- The Streamlit web interface should be deployed with proper authentication in production
- Consider using reverse proxy with SSL/TLS for production deployments

## Third-Party Dependencies

We regularly scan our dependencies for known vulnerabilities using:
- GitHub Dependabot
- Trivy vulnerability scanner
- Bandit security linter

Critical dependency vulnerabilities are addressed as high-priority security issues.

## Security Testing

Our CI/CD pipeline includes:
- Static code analysis with Bandit
- Dependency vulnerability scanning with Trivy
- Automated security testing in our test suite
